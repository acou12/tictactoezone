# The Gerlach Attack: an in-depth guide
## Learn the strengths, weaknesses, and complexities of the stunning 1. b1 opening.

When Franklin Gerlach proposed 1. b1 as a serious opening in 1835, his collegues thought he was joking; in October that same year at the International Open TicTacToeâ„¢ Championship, he got the last laugh, taking the 1st place prize with 1. b1. 

Ununtuitive to most at first, the Garlach is a quiet opening that can become dangerous very quickly. In this guide we'll go over the main ideas of the Garlach, as well as some of its counters.

The primary idea of 1. b1 is to begin building up the first rank as well as the crucial b file simultaneously.

One common answer is 1.. b2, a respectable move that shuts down X's b file attack. Following this, X has a few options: they can respond simply with 2. a1 or c1, completely closing the position and essentially forcing a draw, as O would be forced to close the rank with 2.. c1 or a1.

However, a sharper and more common move is 2. a3!, commonly know as the Kepler variation. This opens up two attacking possibilities: on the third rank as well as the a file.
