## Some tips and trips from resident economist Philliam Reed.

## Introduction

Trying to decide between the millions and millions of TicTacToeZone™ ranks when you're just starting out can be really overwhelming. However, a good grasp on the rank system can be crucial in ensuring you have the features you need for competitive play, while staying within your budget. In this article, I'll go over the very basics of the rank system, warn against some common mistakes, and provide my recommendations for five ranks you should start with as a new player.

## An Overview

The TicTacToeZone™ ranking system is one of the most complex of it's kind. Aligning with TicTacToeZone™'s goal of giving the control back to the users, the system was designed to give users maximum flexibility on the features they get. As a result, there is a rank for every possible combination of features. To start, let's go over some key vocab used by scholars in the field of Critial TicTacToeZone™ Rank Theory. First off, there are a variety of **rank groups** that tend to have similar properties:

- **Traditional Ranks**: Free, Budget, Starter, Hobby, Standard, Member
- **Contemporary Ranks**: Supporter, Pro, Premium
- **Greek Ranks**: Ranks represented by a greek letter. This category also contains two common subgroups:
    - **Vowelic Ranks**: Ranks represented by a greek vowel. (namely, Alpha, Eta, Epsilon, Iota, Omicron, Omega, Upsilon)
    - **Consonantal Ranks**: Ranks represented by a greek consonant. (any Greek Ranks not listed above)
- **Metallic Ranks**: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum
- **Crown Ranks**: Legend, Diamond, Master

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I recommend the Hyper Gamma++++ SuperPlus Extra rank ($22,255.99) for anyone just starting out. However, users looking for a lighter load on the wallet should consider the Ultra Hobby SuperExtra rank ($3,713.99) instead. In general, I recommend staying away from vowelic or metallic ranks, as well as any tri-plus or ultimate ranks, as these tend to offer less value in general; on the other hand, consonantal ranks as well as the traditional series tends to perform very well on the model. At the end of the day, choose the rank that resonantes most with you, and stick with it.
