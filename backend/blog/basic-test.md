# This is a basic test of the markdown capabilities.
## Testing testing 123 and all that.

You can use astrisks for **bolding**, and maybe ~~strikethrough?~~ Underscores are reserved for _captions. these are used for annotating boards mostly._

Speaking of boards... they start with the **@board** annotation, and compose of a markdown board, similar to a table. For example, this:

\@board
|x|o|x|
|o|x|o|
|o|x|o|

would be converted into this:

@board
|x|o|x|
|o|x|o|
|o|x|o|

_This is a draw, sometimes called a "cat"._
